# [Name of Project] [build badges go here when available]

>[Brief description - what is the project and value does it provide? How often should users expect to get releases? How is versioning set up? Where does this project want to go?]

## Installation

> [Include a step-by-step procedure on how to get your code installed. Be sure to include any third-party dependencies that need to be installed separately]

## Getting Started
>[Simple steps to start working with the software similar to a "Hello World"]

## Usage
>[**Optional** - Include more thorough instructions on how to use the software. This section might not be needed if the Getting Started section is enough. Remove this section if it's not needed.]


## Building

>[**Optional** - Include this section if users will need to follow specific instructions to build the software from source. Be sure to include any third party build dependencies that need to be installed separately. Remove this section if it's not needed.]

## Testing

>[**Optional** - Include instructions on how to run tests if we include tests with the codebase. Remove this section if it's not needed.]


## Run local environment

We use minikube and Tilt to launch a local cluster and deploy the [main chart](charts/newrelic-prometheus/) and a set of testing endpoints from the [test-resource](charts/internal/test-resources/).

Make sure you have these tools or install them:
- [Install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- [Install Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
- [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

Start the local environment:
```shell
make local-env-start
```

Notice that local images are build and pushed to docker running inside the minikube cluster since we are running `eval $(minikube docker-env)` before launching Tilt.

## Support
