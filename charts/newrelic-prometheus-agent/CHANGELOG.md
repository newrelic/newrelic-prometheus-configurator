## Unreleased

### enhancements
- added `k8s-app` label in `integration_filters`.
- added `kube-dns` label value in `integration_filters` to cover `coreDNS` use-case.

### bugfix
- chart readme was outdated with respect the new default behaviour of integrations_filters.

## v0.3.1 - 2022-11-08

### 🚀 Enhancements
- the chart is now applying by default a series of relabel configs to fix metric types for Cockroach db service.
- the chart is now scraping by default Cockroach db service as well.

### 🐞 Bug fixes

## v0.2.0 - 2022-11-03

### Note, defaults of the chart changed
Now, the chart has two jobs configured and integration filters turned on by default:
- `default` scrapes all targets having `prometheus.io/scrape: true`. By default, `integrations_filter.enabled=true`, unless changed, only targets selected by the integration filters will be scraped.
- `newrelic` scrapes all targets having `newrelic.io/scrape: true`. This is useful to extend the `default` job allowlisting by adding the required annotation on each extra service.
